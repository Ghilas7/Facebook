# Facebook 'name by phone number' vulnerability

Hi everyone,

In order to show that the last security flaw that I discovered is really a security flaw (unlike what the sec guys of facebook say), I've written a small bash script that generates random phone number (you chose the format) then looks up for the corresponding name, you must have Tor installed, as well as wget and torsocks, you can run multiple instances of that script, do not use excessive number of tor instances when the script will ask for a port range (10 to 20 ports is good), also do not run excessive number of instances (the number of the ports divided by 2 is good enough), to terminate each instance, press Ctrl-C, it will then ask you if you want to kill all tor instances, say "no" if you have other instances of the script runing, it will than outputs ix.io link where have been uploaded found number, you can paste the link here (in reddit) if you wish so we can construct a big database to show to FB that it is really a security issue ;-), enjoy
